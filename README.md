# leap-wireless
These files are a project for a wireless leap motion connection
using the server and client files will allow for a CSV file to be recorded to the local host and then sent to the client connection
a framework is set for future development so that there is no local file required
using the local file you can create a csv file of leap motion data and apply it to a the leap motion skeleton provided by selecting
the hand bones and using the motion builder script
this will apply the leap motion data in the locla CSV to the hand bones
